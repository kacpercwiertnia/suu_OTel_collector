## Introduction

The OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector is a crucial component of the OpenTelemetry observability framework. It acts as a central point for collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data (traces, metrics, and logs) from applications and infrastructure. It's designed to be configurable, extensible, and vendor-agnostic, allowing for seamless integration with various observability backends.
